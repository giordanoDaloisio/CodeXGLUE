2	In Java, the readLines() method is used to read the contents of a file line by line. The method returns an immutable list of strings, where each string represents a line in the file. Here is an example of how to use the readLines() method: import java.io.*; import java.util.*; public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { try { BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt")); List<String> lines = reader.readLines(); for (String line : lines) { System.out.println(line); } } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } } In

6	* This method is called when we want to start draining data from the buffer. If the buffer is empty, we double its capacity and allocate a new buffer. If the buffer is not empty, we set a flag to indicate that we are in the process of draining the buffer. Description: This method is called when we want to start draining data from the buffer. If the buffer is empty, we double its capacity and allocate a new buffer. If the buffer is not empty, we set a flag to indicate

8	In Java, the isEmpty() method is used to check if a collection is empty or not. It returns true if the collection is empty, and false otherwise. The isEmpty() method is defined in the Collection interface, which is implemented by all collection classes in Java, including ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, and TreeSet. Here is an example of how to use the isEmpty() method to check if an ArrayList is empty: ArrayList list = new ArrayList ( ) ; if ( list. isEmpty ( ) ) { System. out. println ( "The list is empty." ) ; } else { System. out. println ( "The list is
9	In Java, the toIterator() method is a static method of the Function class in the java.util.function package. It is used to convert an Iterable object to an Iterator object. The toIterator() method takes an Iterable object as an argument and returns an Iterator object that can be used to iterate over the elements of the Iterable object. The Iterator object returned by the toIterator() method can be used to iterate over the elements of the Iterable object using the hasNext() and next() methods.
10	A utility method that returns an iterator that iterates over the elements of an array, consuming each element as it is returned. The returned iterator is unmodifiable.
11	In Java, the concatNoDefensiveCopy method is a static method that takes an array of Iterator objects as input and returns a new Iterator object that concatenates the elements of the input iterators. The method does not perform any defensive copying, which means that it does not create a new array to store the elements of the input iterators. Instead, it simply returns a new Iterator object that iterates over the elements of the input iterators in the order they were provided. This method is useful when you want to concatenate the elements of multiple iterators without creating a new array to store the elements.
12	In Java, the clear() method of the Iterator interface is used to remove all elements from the collection that the iterator is currently iterating over. This method is typically used in conjunction with the hasNext() and next() methods to remove elements from a collection while iterating over it. The hasNext() method is used to check if there are any more elements in the collection, and the next() method is used to retrieve the next element in the collection. The clear() method is then used to remove all elements from the collection.
13	As of Guava 19.0, this method will throw an exception if bytes is null. Previously, it did not throw an exception if bytes was null, but instead wrote no bytes to the stream.
14	Splits a cache builder specification string into a CacheBuilderSpec. Parameters: cacheBuilderSpecification - the cache builder specification string. Returns: the CacheBuilderSpec.
15	.See the javadoc for CacheBuilder for more details. Code: CacheBuilder < Object, Object > toCacheBuilder ( ) { CacheBuilder < Object, Object > builder = CacheBuilder. newBuilder ( ) ; if ( initialCapacity!= null ) { builder. initialCapacity ( initialCapacity ) ; }

17	In the given code, the checkArgument method is used to ensure that the total number of elements in the rest array does not exceed the maximum value that can be stored in an int. This is done by checking if the length of the rest array plus 1 (for the first element) is less than or equal to the maximum value that can be stored in an int. If this condition is not met, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown.
18	In Java, the ImmutableIntArray class provides a method called subArray() that returns a subarray of the original array. The subArray() method takes two parameters: startIndex and endIndex. The startIndex parameter represents the index of the first element in the subarray, and the endIndex parameter represents the index of the last element in the subarray (exclusive). The subArray() method returns a new ImmutableIntArray object that contains the elements from the original array between the startIndex and endIndex indices. If the startIndex is equal to the endIndex, the subArray() method returns an empty ImmutableIntArray object. The subArray() method uses the checkPositionIndexes
19	In Java, the @Override annotation is used to indicate that a method is overriding a method in a superclass. The @CanIgnoreReturnValue annotation is used to indicate that a method does not return a value. The public modifier is used to indicate that the method is accessible to all classes. The int return type is used to indicate that the method returns an integer value. The throws IOException clause is used to indicate that the method can throw an IOException. The read() method is used to read a single byte of data from the input stream and return it as an integer. If the end of the stream is reached, the method returns -1
20	Code: @ Override @ CanIgnoreReturnValue public int read ( byte [ ] bytes, int off, int len ) throws IOException { int numOfBytesRead = in. read ( bytes, off, len ) ; if ( numOfBytesRead!= - 1 ) { hasher. putBytes ( bytes, off, numOfBytesRead ) ; } return numOfBytesRead ; }
Code: @ Override @ CanIgnoreReturnValue public int read ( byte [ ] bytes, int off, int len ) throws IOException { int numOfBytesRead = in. read ( bytes, off, len ) ; if ( numOfBytesRead!= - 1 )

Code: static < K, V > Map < K, V > readMap ( Class < K > keyClass, Class < V > valueClass, ObjectInputStream stream ) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException { Map < K, V > map = new HashMap < K, V > ( ) ; int size = stream. readInt ( ) ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < size ; i ++ ) { K key = ( K ) stream. readObject ( ) ; V value = ( V ) stream. readObject ( ) ; map. put ( key, value )
22	In this example, the writeMultiset method takes a Multiset and an ObjectOutputStream as input and writes the contents of the multiset to the output stream. The method first gets the number of entries in the multiset using the entrySet method and writes it to the stream using the writeInt method. Then, it iterates over the entry set of the multiset and writes each element and its count to the stream using the writeObject and writeInt methods respectively.
23	A FieldSetter is used to set the value of a field on an instance of a class. Code: static < T > FieldSetter < T > getFieldSetter ( final Class < T > clazz, String fieldName ) { try { Field field = clazz. getDeclaredField ( fieldName ) ; return new FieldSetter < T > ( field ) ; } catch ( NoSuchFieldException e ) { throw new AssertionError ( e ) ; // programmer error } } Summary: A FieldSetter is used to set the value of a field on an instance of a class. Code: static < T > FieldSetter < T > getFieldSetter ( final Class
24	A Stopwatch is a utility class that helps you to measure elapsed time. It provides methods to start, stop, and reset the stopwatch, as well as methods to get the elapsed time in nanoseconds, milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, and days. It also provides a method to get the elapsed time as a human-readable string. Code: @ CanIgnoreReturnValue public Stopwatch start ( ) { checkState (! isRunning, "This stopwatch is already running." ) ; isRunning = true ; startTick = ticker. read ( ) ; return this ; }

31	* This class implements the Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) address type. This class represents an Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) address. An IPv6 address is a 128-bit identifier for an interface, or set of interfaces, to which it is assigned. An IPv6 address is represented as a 128-bit unsigned integer value, written as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, each group representing 16 bits. The groups are separated by colons. An example of an IPv6 address is 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:

37	In this example, the isMappedIPv4Address method takes a string representing an IP address and returns a boolean value indicating whether the IP address is a mapped IPv4 address. The method uses the ipStringToBytes method to convert the IP address string to a byte array, and then checks if the length of the byte array is 16. If the length is 16, the method checks if the first 10 bytes of the byte array are all zero, and if the 11th and 12th bytes are equal to 255. If these conditions are met, the method returns true, indicating that the IP address is
38	Splits an InetAddress into a byte array, decrements the last byte of the array, and returns a new InetAddress.
39	In Java, the BufferedReader class is used to read text from a character-input stream, buffering characters so as to provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines. The buffer size may be specified, or the default size may be used. The default is large enough for most purposes. In general, each read request made of a Reader causes a corresponding read request to be made of the underlying character or byte stream. It is therefore advisable to wrap a BufferedReader around any Reader whose read() operations may be costly, such as FileReaders and InputStreamReaders. For example, here is how to read a single line of text
40	In Java, the write() method of the File class is used to write the contents of a byte array to a file. This method takes two arguments: the first argument is the byte array to be written, and the second argument is the file to which the contents of the byte array should be written. The write() method throws an IOException if an I/O error occurs. Example: Here is an example of how to use the write() method of the File class to write the contents of a byte array to a file: public class Main { public static void main ( String [ ] args ) throws IOException { byte [ ] bytes =

The natural ordering of the elements is used to order the priority queue by default, but a custom comparator can be used by creating the priority queue with a Comparator parameter that provides an alternative ordering. The elements of the priority queue must be instances of a class that implements the Comparable interface (or any subclass of Comparable). The natural ordering of the elements is used to order the priority queue by default, but a custom comparator can be used by creating the priority queue with a
48	In this code, the calculateNewCapacity method calculates the new capacity of an array based on the old capacity. If the old capacity is less than 64, the new capacity is calculated by multiplying the old capacity by 2 and adding 1. If the old capacity is greater than or equal to 64, the new capacity is calculated by dividing the old capacity by 2 and multiplying it by 3. Finally, the new capacity is capped at the maximum size if it exceeds the maximum size.

The ElementOrder class is a generic class that represents the order of elements in a collection. The natural method returns an instance of the ElementOrder class that uses the natural order of the elements in the collection. The natural order is the default order of the elements in the collection, which is determined by the type of the elements in the collection. For example, if the elements in the collection are strings, the natural order is the alphabetical order of the strings. If the elements in the collection are integers, the natural

55	In this code, the method enterWhenUninterruptibly takes a Guard object as an argument and checks if the monitor of the guard is equal to the current thread. If not, it throws an IllegalMonitorStateException. Then, it obtains the lock of the current thread and checks if the lock is held by the current thread. If it is, it sets signalBeforeWaiting to true. Otherwise, it sets signalBeforeWaiting to false. It then locks the lock and checks if the guard is satisfied. If it is not, it calls awaitUninterruptibly with the guard and signalBeforeWaiting as arguments. Finally, it checks if the

58	In this method, the guard is used to check if the condition is satisfied or not. If the condition is not satisfied, the lock is unlocked and the method returns false. If the condition is satisfied, the lock is not unlocked and the method returns true. Description: This method is used to check if the condition is satisfied or not. If the condition is not satisfied, the lock is unlocked and the method returns false.
59	In the tryEnterIf method of the Guard class, the if statement checks if the monitor field of the guard object is equal to the current object. If they are not equal, an IllegalMonitorStateException is thrown. This ensures that the guard object and the current object are the same, which is a necessary condition for the guard to be able to monitor the current object. The tryLock method of the ReentrantLock class is then called to attempt to acquire the lock. If the lock cannot be acquired, the method returns false. Otherwise, the isSatisfied method of the guard object is called to determine if the guard is satisfied.

65	In this example, the signalAllWaiters method iterates through the activeGuards list and signals all the waiters for each guard. This is done by calling the signalAll method on the condition object associated with each guard.
66	In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the wait() and notify() methods of the Object class in Java with the help of examples. The wait() and notify() methods of the Object class are used for inter-thread communication. The wait() method causes the current thread to wait until some other thread invokes the notify() method or the notifyAll() method for this object. The notify() method wakes up a single thread that is waiting on this object's monitor. The notifyAll() method wakes up all threads that are waiting on this object's monitor. The notify() and notifyAll() methods should only be called by a thread

70	In Guava 16.0, the Closer.close() method was changed to throw a RuntimeException instead of an IOException. This change was made in order to make it easier to use the Closer class in a try-with-resources statement. However, this change has caused problems for some users who were relying on the fact that Closer.close() would throw an IOException.

75	In Java, the create method is a static method in the MediaType class that is used to create a new MediaType object. The method takes three parameters: type, subtype, and parameters. The type and subtype parameters are used to specify the type and subtype of the media type, respectively. The parameters parameter is used to specify any additional parameters that may be associated with the media type. The method returns a new MediaType object with the specified type, subtype, and parameters.

77	In this tutorial, we will learn how to check if a class is parameterized or not in Java. We can check if a class is parameterized or not by using the isAssignableFrom() method of the Class class. The isAssignableFrom() method of the Class class returns true if the class or interface represented by this Class object is either the same as, or is a superclass or superinterface of, the class or interface represented by the specified Class parameter. In other words, this method returns true if the class or interface represented by the specified Class parameter can be cast to the class or interface represented by this Class object without an exception being

94	In Java, the reverseOrder() method is a static method of the Ordering class in the java.util package. It is used to create an ordering that reverses the natural ordering of the elements. The natural ordering is the default ordering of the elements based on their type. For example, the natural ordering of strings is alphabetical order, while the natural ordering of integers is numerical order. The reverseOrder() method returns a new ordering that reverses the natural ordering of the elements. For example, if the natural ordering of strings is alphabetical order, then the reverseOrder() method will return an ordering that sorts strings in reverse alphabetical order. The
95	In this code, the retainOccurrencesImpl method takes two Multiset objects as input: multisetToModify and occurrencesToRetain. The method iterates over the entrySet of multisetToModify and checks if the count of each element in occurrencesToRetain is 0. If the count is 0, the element is removed from multisetToModify. If the count is less than the current count of the element in multisetToModify, the count of the element in multisetToModify is set to the count in occurrencesToRetain. The method returns true if any changes were made to multisetToModify

151	In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the transformEntry() method of the Entry class with the help of examples.

## 1. transformEntry() Method

The transformEntry() method is a static method of the Entry class. It is used to transform the given entry using the given EntryTransformer.

### 1.1 Syntax

The syntax of the transformEntry() method is
```
public static <V2, K, V1> Entry<K, V2> transformEntry(EntryTransformer<? super K,? super V1, V2> transformer, Entry<K, V1> entry)
```
152	< K, V1, V2 > Entry < K, V2 > transformEntry ( final EntryTransformer <? super K,? super V1, V2 > transformer, final Entry < K, V1 > entry ) { return new AbstractMap.SimpleEntry < K, V2 > ( entry. getKey ( ), transformer. transform ( entry. getKey ( ), entry. getValue ( ) ) ) ; }
153	In the above code, the indexMap method takes a collection of elements and returns an immutable map where each element is mapped to its index in the original collection. The method uses an ImmutableMap.Builder to build the map, which is a utility class that provides a convenient way to create immutable maps. The method iterates over the elements in the collection and adds each element to the builder with its index as the value. Finally, the method returns the built map.

The Package object contains information about the package, such as its name, version, and permissions. The method then uses the PackageParser class to generate a PackageInfo object, which contains more detailed information about the package. The PackageInfo object is then used to install the package on the system. Finally, the method adds filters for the activities, services, providers, and receivers in the package to the system.

393	In this article, we will show you how to add an intent filter for a provider in Android. We will use the addIntentFilterForProvider() method of the ComponentName class to add an intent filter for a provider. This method takes three parameters: the ComponentName of the provider, the IntentFilter to add, and the providerFilters array. The providerFilters array is an array of IntentFilter objects that represent the filters for the provider. The addIntentFilterForProvider() method will add the IntentFilter to the providerFilters array if it is not already present. If the IntentFilter is already present, the method will do nothing

601	The createIfNull method is used to create an array of a given type if the input array is null. If the input array is not null, the method returns the input array. This method is useful when you need to ensure that an array is not null before using it in your code. Example: public class Main { public static void main ( String [ ] args ) { String [ ] names = { "John", "Jane", "Bob" } ; String [ ] names2 = createIfNull ( names ) ; for ( String name : names2 ) { System. out. println ( name ) ; }
602	In Java, the createIfNull method is a static method that returns a new set if the current value is null, or returns the current value if it is not null. This method is useful when you want to create a new set if the current value is null, but you don't want to modify the current value if it is not null. For example, if you have a method that takes a set as an argument, and you want to create a new set if the argument is null, you can use the createIfNull method to do so.

796	In the given code, the method getKeys() is used to retrieve the keys of a configuration. However, there is a possibility of a ConcurrentModificationException being thrown when iterating over the keys. This exception occurs when the underlying data structure is modified while the iteration is in progress. To handle this exception, a try-catch block is used to catch the exception and log an error message. If the exception is caught, it is rethrown so that it can be handled by the caller of the method. The try-catch block ensures that the iteration is not interrupted and the keys are retrieved correctly.
797	As the name suggests, this method returns an iterator over all the keys in the configuration that start with the given prefix. The keys are returned in the order in which they are stored in the configuration, which may or may not be the same as the order in which they were added. This method is useful for iterating over all the keys in the configuration that start with a particular prefix, without having to worry about the order in which they were added.
798	As you can see, the containsKey() method first checks if the overrideProperties map contains the key. If it does, it returns true immediately. Otherwise, it iterates through the configList and checks if any of the Configuration objects contain the key. If it finds a match, it returns true. If none of the Configuration objects contain the key, it returns false.

If the index is greater than 0, we return the node at the index-1 position, which is the node with the next lowest sequence number. If the index is 0, it means the given node is the node with the lowest sequence number, so we return the node itself. If the index is -1, it means the given node is not in the list, so we return null.

The method uses a while loop to iterate over the characters in the buffer, and for each character, it checks if it matches any of the input characters. If a match is found, the loop is broken and the method returns the substring of the buffer up to the matched character. Otherwise, the loop continues until the end of the buffer is reached, and the method returns an empty string.

871	In this article, we will show you how to check if a string is null or empty in Java. There are several ways to check if a string is null or empty in Java. One way is to use the String.isEmpty() method. This method returns true if the string is empty, and false otherwise. Another way is to use the String.length() method. This method returns the length of the string, which will be 0 if the string is empty. Finally, you can also use the == operator to check if the string is null or empty. This will return true if the string is null or empty, and false otherwise

The key is the object that you want to use as the key, and the value is the object that you want to use as the value. The put() method returns the previous value associated with the specified key, or null if there was no mapping for the key. A null value can also be returned if the map previously associated null with the key, or if the map previously associated null with the key
874	In MongoDB, the majority write concern is a setting that determines how many nodes in a replica set must respond to a write operation before the operation is considered successful. The majority write concern ensures that the data is written to a majority of the nodes in the replica set, providing a higher level of data consistency and fault tolerance. However, using the majority write concern can result in slower write operations, as the operation must wait for a majority of the nodes to respond before it can be considered successful. In this code, the applyMajorityWriteConcernToTransactionOptions method is used to ensure that the majority write concern is applied to the transaction options

1075	In Java, the getBoolean() method is used to retrieve a boolean value from a Map object. The method takes two arguments: the key of the value to retrieve and a default value to return if the key is not found in the map. The method returns the value associated with the specified key, or the default value if the key is not found. If the value associated with the key is not a boolean, the method will throw an IllegalArgumentException.
1076	In this example, the getObjectId method takes a field name and a default value as input and returns the value of the field if it exists, or the default value if the field does not exist. The method uses the get method to retrieve the value of the field and casts it to an ObjectId if it is not null. If the field does not exist or its value is null, the method returns the default value.
1077	In this example, the getDate method returns the value of the specified field as a Date object. If the field is null, the method returns the specified default value. The method uses the instanceof operator to check if the value of the field is a Date object. If it is not, the method returns the default value.

The cosine of 0° is 1, and it is less than 1 for any other angle. It is thus a judgment of orientation and not magnitude: two vectors with the same orientation have a cosine similarity of 1, two vectors at 90° have a similarity of 0, and two vectors diametrically opposed have a similarity of -1, independent of their magnitude. Cosine similarity is particularly used in positive space, where the outcome is neatly bounded

1291	In this article, we will discuss how to check if an object has a specific property in Java. There are several ways to do this, but the most common method is to use the instanceof operator. This operator checks if an object is an instance of a class or interface. If the object is an instance of the specified class or interface, the instanceof operator returns true; otherwise, it returns false. Another way to check if an object has a specific property is to use the getClass() method. This method returns the class of the object. You can then check if the class of the object is the same as the class of the property

The method takes two parameters: processEngine, which is an instance of the ProcessEngine class, and processDefinitionId, which is the ID of the process definition. The method first gets the process definition using the getProcessDefinition method of the RepositoryService interface. It then gets the name of the process application that made the deployment using the getProcessApplicationForDeployment method of the ManagementService interface. If the process application name is null, it means that the deployment was not made by a process application
1351	In this method, we first get the ProcessEngineService and ProcessApplicationService from the BpmPlatform. Then, we iterate over all process applications using the getProcessApplicationNames() method of the ProcessApplicationService. For each process application, we get the ProcessApplicationInfo using the getProcessApplicationInfo() method. We then iterate over all deployments of the process application using the getDeploymentInfo() method. For each deployment, we use the getProcessEngineName() method to get the process engine name and the getDeploymentId() method to get the deployment ID. We then use the getProcessEngine() method of the ProcessEngineService

1422	In Java, the Duration.divide(long amount) method is a method of the Duration class that is used to divide a Duration object by a given amount. This method returns a new Duration object that represents the result of the division. The amount parameter is the amount by which the Duration object is to be divided. For example, if the Duration object represents 1 day and the amount parameter is 2, the result of the division will be 0.5 days. The Duration.divide(long amount) method is a static method, which means that it can be called without creating an instance of the Duration class.

A singly linked list is headed by a pointer to the first node of the list, called the head of the list. The last node is termed the tail, and the empty list has a null head and tail. A singly linked list is said to be circular if and only if the tail contains a link to the head; that is, the tail points to the head. Sometimes, a reference to the last node of the list is needed

1524	In this code, the jsonToJava method takes a JSON string and a Map of optional arguments as input. If the optionalArgs parameter is null, a new HashMap is created with the USE_MAPS key set to false. If the optionalArgs map does not contain the USE_MAPS key, it is added with a value of false. A JsonReader object is created using the json and optionalArgs parameters. The readObject method is called on the JsonReader object to parse the JSON string and return the resulting object. Finally, the close method is called on the JsonReader object to release any resources it may be holding.
1525	In this tutorial, we will learn how to convert a JSON object to a Java object using the Jackson library. To convert a JSON object to a Java object, we can use the ObjectMapper class from the Jackson library. The ObjectMapper class provides a method called readValue() that can be used to convert a JSON object to a Java object. The readValue() method takes two arguments: the first argument is the JSON object to be converted, and the second argument is the class of the Java object to which the JSON object should be converted. Here is an example of how to use the ObjectMapper class to convert a JSON object to a Java object

1556	Candlestick charts are a type of chart that displays the high, low, open, and close prices of a security for a specific period. They are commonly used in technical analysis to identify trends, support and resistance levels, and potential entry and exit points for trades. Candlestick charts are also known as OHLC charts, as they display the open, high, low, and close prices of a security for a specific period. The candlesticks are color-coded to indicate whether the close price is higher or lower than the open price. Green candlesticks indicate that the close price is higher than the open price, while red candlesticks indicate

1862	In Java, the setString() method is a method of the CacheEntry class that is used to set the value of a key-value pair in a cache. The method takes a String value as an argument and returns the CacheEntry object. The method is used to set the value of a key-value pair in a cache, where the key is the name of the key-value pair and the value is the value of the key-value pair. The method is typically used in conjunction with the get() method, which is used to retrieve the value of a key-value pair in a cache. The setString() method is used to set the

1866	In Android, the clear() method of the LruCache class is used to clear all entries from the cache. This is useful when you want to clear the cache and start with a clean slate. The method takes no parameters and does not return any value. To use this method, you need to create an instance of the LruCache class and call the clear() method on it. For example: LruCache cache = new LruCache(100); cache.clear(); This will clear all entries from the cache.

1871	In Android, the onBackPressed() method is called when the user presses the back button on the device. This method is used to override the default behavior of the back button, which is to close the current activity. In this example, the onBackPressed() method is overridden to check if the current fragment is null. If the current fragment is not null, the method calls the processBackPressed() method of the current fragment. If the processBackPressed() method returns true, the onBackPressed() method returns without doing anything. If the processBackPressed() method returns false, the onBackPressed() method checks if the back stack count is less than or equal to 1

Next, we show the overlay animation with a duration of SHOW_OVERLAY_ANIM_DURATION. After that, we morph the FAB into the sheet using the morphIntoSheet method, which takes an AnimationListener as a parameter. In the AnimationListener, we check if the event listener is not null and call its onSheetShown method if it is. We also set the isShowing flag to false to indicate that

1905	In the above code, the updateFab method is used to update the visibility of the floating action button (FAB) based on the selected page. The switch statement checks the selectedPage parameter and sets the visibility of the FAB accordingly. If the selectedPage is MainPagerAdapter.ALL_POS, the FAB is shown. If the selectedPage is MainPagerAdapter.SHARED_POS, the FAB is shown with an offset of -getResources().getDimensionPixelSize(R.dimen.snackbar_height).

1908	In this code, the morphFromSheet method is used to create a morph animation from a sheet. The method takes several parameters, including the end position of the animation (endX and endY), the side of the sheet (side), the angle of the arc (arcDegrees), the scale factor (scaleFactor), the duration of the animation (duration), and an animation listener (listener). The method first sets the visibility of the fab (floating action button) to visible, and then calls the morph method with the specified parameters.
1909	In the hideSuggestionsIfNecessary method, the code checks if the current query is waiting for results and if the query token string is equal to the current token string. If both conditions are true, the suggestions visibility manager is instructed to hide the suggestions. However, the code does not check if the suggestions are already hidden, which could lead to an unnecessary call to the displaySuggestions method. This could result in a performance impact, especially if the suggestions are hidden frequently. To fix this issue, the code should be updated to check if the suggestions are already hidden before calling the displaySuggestions method.
1910	.Suggestible is an interface that can be implemented by any class that needs to provide suggestions for a query. The getSuggestions method returns a list of suggestions for the given query token. The query token is a string that represents the user's input. The getSuggestions method should return a list of suggestions that are relevant to the query token. For example, if the query token is "apple", the getSuggestions method might return a list of suggestions such as "apple pie", "apple sauce", and "apple juice". The getSuggestions method should be implemented in a way that is efficient and scalable. It should be able to handle a

1912	In this code, the containsWordBreakingChar method checks if a given CharSequence contains any word-breaking characters. The method iterates over each character in the input string and checks if it is a word-breaking character using the isWordBreakingChar method. If a word-breaking character is found, the method returns true. Otherwise, it returns false. The isWordBreakingChar method checks if a given character is a word-breaking character by comparing it to a list of known word-breaking characters. If the character is found in the list, it is considered a word-breaking character and the method returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

2138	In this method, the readNextProtoBytes method is called to read the next bytes from the input stream. If the bytes are not null, the fromBytes method of the protoConverter is called to convert the bytes into an object of type M. The set method of the writable object is then called to set the converted object. Finally, true is returned to indicate that the next object was read successfully. If the bytes are null, false is returned to indicate that there are no more objects to read.
2139	In this method, the code first checks if a new block needs to be set up. If not, it returns null. Otherwise, it decrements the number of bytes left to read in the current block, retrieves the current blob, and checks if it is empty. If it is empty and skipEmptyRecords is true, it continues the loop. Otherwise, it returns the blob.
2140	In this example, the readNextProtoBytes method reads the next byte array from the input stream and stores it in the BytesWritable object passed as an argument. The method returns true if a byte array was read successfully, or false if the end of the input stream was reached.

2337	In this code, the method fromFile is used to load a GTFS feed from a file. The method takes two parameters: file, which is the path to the GTFS file, and feedId, which is the ID of the feed. The method first creates a new GTFSFeed object and then tries to load the feed from the file using the loadFromFile method. If the feedId parameter is not null, the loadFromFile method is called with the feedId parameter. Otherwise, the loadFromFile method is called without any parameters. Finally, the method returns the loaded GTFSFeed object.

2340	As the name suggests, this method returns the average speed of a trip in meters per second. Parameters: trip_id - the id of the trip for which to calculate the speed straightLine - if true, the distance is calculated as the straight line distance between the first and last stop of the trip; if false, the distance is calculated as the sum of the straight line distances between consecutive stops. Returns: the average speed of the trip in meters per second, or NaN if the trip does not have any stop times.
2341	In this code, the getStopTimesForStop method takes a stop_id as input and returns a list of StopTime objects for that stop. The method uses a SortedSet to find the stop times for the given stop_id. The SortedSet is created using the stopStopTimeSet field, which is a SortedSet of Tuple2 objects. Each Tuple2 object contains a stop_id and a StopTime object. The subSet method is used to find the stop times for the given stop_id. The stream method is used to map the Tuple2 objects to StopTime objects and the collect method is used to collect the StopTime objects
2342	In this code, the getServicesForDate method takes a LocalDate object as input and returns a List of Service objects. The method first formats the date into a string using the dateFormatter object, and then uses the servicesPerDate SortedSet to find the services that correspond to that date. The servicesPerDate SortedSet is a SortedSet of Tuple2 objects, where the first element of each tuple is the date string and the second element is the service ID. The method then uses a stream to map each tuple to its corresponding service object, and collects the results into a List using the Collectors.toList method.

2347	In this code, the reportNewIdleState method is used to update the idle state of jobs in the JobStore. The method takes a Context and a boolean value indicating whether the device is in idle state or not. It then initializes the JobStore and gets the list of jobs. For each job, it sets the idleConstraintSatisfied field to the given boolean value. Finally, it starts a wakeful service to run the jobs.

2349	In this code, the containsJobId method is used to check if a job with a specific ID is present in the job set. The method iterates through the job set in reverse order, starting from the last element and checking if the current element matches the given job ID. If a match is found, the method returns true, otherwise it returns false. The method uses the matches method of the JobStatus class to compare the job ID.

2369	In the verify() method of the LtiService class, there is a call to the OAuthServlet.getMessage() method, which uses the getRequestURL() method to get the request URL. However, the getRequestURL() method is vulnerable to an open redirect attack, as it does not validate the request URL before returning it. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to the LTI service, which would allow them to redirect the user to a malicious URL. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information or the execution of arbitrary code on the server.

What is a Quaternion?
A quaternion is a mathematical object that can be used to represent rotations in three-dimensional space. It is often used in computer graphics and game development to represent the orientation of an object. A quaternion consists of a scalar part and a vector part. The scalar part represents the angle of rotation, and the vector part represents the axis of rotation.

If the transformed type parameter is different from the original type parameter, the method creates a new ResolvedType object with the corrected type parameters and returns it. However, the comparison between the transformed type parameter and the original type parameter is done using the identity comparison operator (==), which compares the references of the two objects rather than their values. This can lead to incorrect results if the transformed type parameter is equal to the original type parameter but has a different reference. To fix this issue,

2538	In this tutorial, we will learn how to use WeakHashMap in Java with the help of examples. WeakHashMap is an implementation of the Map interface that uses weak references for its keys. A weak reference is a reference that allows the garbage collector to reclaim the memory of an object if there are no strong references to the object. This means that the key-value pairs in a WeakHashMap can be garbage collected if there are no strong references to the key. This can be useful in situations where you want to keep a reference to an object, but you don't want to prevent the garbage collector from reclaiming the memory of the object if it

2542	In this example, the copyFile method takes two arguments: in, which is a PlexusIoResource, and outFile, which is a File. The method first creates an InputStream from the PlexusIoResource using the getContents method, and then creates an OutputStream from the File using the FileOutputStream constructor. It then uses the IOUtil.copy method to copy the contents of the InputStream to the OutputStream. Finally, it closes both the InputStream and the OutputStream using the IOUtil.close method.
2543	In this article, we will discuss how to check if two files are the same in Java. We will explore different approaches to determine whether two files have the same content or not. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced Java developer, this guide will provide you with the necessary knowledge to implement this functionality in your projects. So, let’s dive in and learn how to check if two files are the same in Java.
How to check if two files are the same in Java?
To check if two files are the same in Java, you can use the equals() method of the File class. This method returns true if the two files

2550	In the above code, the getWarnings() method is used to retrieve a list of warnings from the mainSection object. The warnings are stored in a Vector object called warnings. The hasMoreElements() method is used to check if there are more elements in the enumeration. If there are more elements, the nextElement() method is used to retrieve the next element and add it to the warnings vector. Finally, the elements() method is used to return the elements of the warnings vector.
2551	The getSection method returns the section with the given name, or null if there is no section with that name.
Code: public ExistingSection getSection ( String name ) { Attributes attributes = getAttributes ( name ) ; if ( attributes!= null ) { return new ExistingSection ( attributes, name ) ; } return null ; } Summary:The getSection method returns the section with the given name, or null if there is no section with that name.

Parameters: compression - the compression method file - the file istream - the input stream Returns: the decompressed input stream Throws: IOException - if an I/O error occurs ArchiverException - if the compression method is not supported
2560	As you can see from the code above, we create a GZIPOutputStream and pass it to the compress() method. The GZIPOutputStream is used to compress the contents of the source file and write it to the destination file. The GZIPOutputStream class is part of the java.util.zip package.
2561	In Java, the mergeAttributes() method is used to merge the attributes of two Attributes objects. The method takes two Attributes objects as input and merges the attributes of the second object into the first object. The method returns the first object with the merged attributes. Syntax: public static void mergeAttributes(Attributes target, Attributes section) Parameters: The method takes two parameters: target: The first Attributes object whose attributes will be merged. section: The second Attributes object whose attributes will be merged into the target object.

2565	In this example, the compress() method uses the SnappyOutputStream class to compress the contents of the source file and write it to the destination file. The SnappyOutputStream class uses the Snappy compression algorithm, which is a high-performance compression algorithm designed for large files. The bufferedOutputStream() method creates a BufferedOutputStream object that wraps the fileOutputStream() method, which creates a FileOutputStream object that writes to the destination file. The getDestFile() method returns the destination file, and the getSource() method returns the source file. Finally, the compress() method uses the SnappyOutputStream object to compress the contents of the source file and write

2571	In this example, the compressFile method takes two arguments: an InputStream and an OutputStream. The method uses a byte array of size 8 * 1024 to read data from the input stream and write it to the output stream. The do-while loop reads data from the input stream and writes it to the output stream until the end of the input stream is reached, which is indicated by a return value of -1 from the read method. The write method of the output stream is used to write the data to the output stream.

2600	As the name suggests, the assertNotEqual method is used to assert that two objects are not equal. The method takes three parameters: the description of the assertion, the actual object, and the other object. The method first checks if the actual object is not null. If it is null, the method throws a NullPointerException. If the actual object is not null, the method checks if the actual object is equal to the other object. If the objects are equal, the method throws an AssertionError. If the objects are not equal, the method does not throw any exception and the test passes.
2601	In Java, the assertLessThan method is used to check if the actual value is less than the other value. The method takes two arguments: the actual value and the other value. If the actual value is less than the other value, the method returns true, otherwise it returns false. The assertLessThan method is often used in unit tests to ensure that the output of a method is less than a certain value. For example, if a method is supposed to return a value between 0 and 100, the assertLessThan method can be used to check if the returned value is less than 100.
2602	In Java, the assertNotGreaterThan method is used to check if the actual value is not greater than the expected value. The method takes three arguments: the description of the assertion, the actual value, and the expected value.

2634	In this tutorial, we will learn how to check if a string is empty or not in Java with the help of example programs.
How do you check if a string is not empty in Java?
The isEmpty() method of the String class is used to check if a string is empty or not. This method returns true if the length of the string is 0, otherwise it returns false.
How do you check if a string is not empty in Java 8?
isEmpty() method is used to check if a string is empty or not. This method returns true if the length of the string is 0, otherwise it returns false.
2635	Splits the name of a field into a prefix and a suffix, where the prefix is the first character of the field name in upper case, and the suffix is the rest of the field name. If the field name has only one character, the prefix is the field name. If the first character of the field name is not upper case, the prefix is the field name.

2638	In this code, the expect method is used to set the expected status codes for an HTTP request. The method takes an array of integers as an argument, which represents the expected status codes. If the length of the array is 1 and the first element is less than 0, then the anyStatus flag is set to true, indicating that any status code is acceptable. Otherwise, the anyStatus flag is set to false, and the expectedStatuses list is cleared and populated with the provided status codes. The method returns the current instance of the class, allowing for method chaining.

2640	In Java, the getBooleanProperty method is used to retrieve the value of a boolean property from a PropertyOracle object. The method takes four parameters: the logger, the propertyOracle, the name of the property, and the default value to return if the property is not found. The method first attempts to retrieve the value of the property using the getSelectionProperty method of the PropertyOracle object. If the property is found, its value is returned. If the property is not found, a BadPropertyValueException is thrown, and the default value is returned.

2656	In this example, the getJaxRsClient() method checks if a JAX-RS client has already been created. If not, it creates a new JAX-RS client using the createJaxRsClient() method. It then sets the connection timeout and read timeout for the JAX-RS client. Finally, it returns the JAX-RS client.

2658	.Several JAX-RS client implementations (Jersey, Apache CXF, WebSphere) allow to set the connection timeout by calling ClientBuilder.connectTimeout() method. However, this method was introduced in JAX-RS API 2.1 (Java EE 8) and is not available in JAX-RS API 2.0 (Java EE 7). In order to set the connection timeout in JAX-RS API 2.0 (Java EE 7), it is necessary to call ClientBuilder.property() method. However, this method has to be called multiple times in order to set the connection
2659	As of JAX-RS API 2.1 (Java EE 8), there is a standardized way to set the read timeout using the ClientBuilder.readTimeout method. Before JAX-RS API 2.1 (Java EE 8), there was no standardized way to set the read timeout. As a result, each JAX-RS client implementation has its own way to set the read timeout.

2746	Question: What is the purpose of the code? Answer: The code is used to retrieve a CloudTable object that represents the minute metrics table for a specific storage service and location. The code uses a switch statement to determine which table to retrieve based on the storage service and location provided. If the location is not specified, the code assumes it is the primary location. The code then returns the appropriate CloudTable object.
2747	In the getMessageContentAsByte method, if the messageContent is null or empty, a new byte array of length 0 is returned. If the messageType is QueueMessageType.RAW_STRING, the messageContent is converted to a byte array using the UTF-8 character set. Otherwise, the messageContent is decoded using Base64.
2748	In the getMessageContentAsString() method, if the messageType is QueueMessageType.RAW_STRING, the method returns the messageContent. Otherwise, if the messageContent is null or empty, the method returns null. If the messageContent is not null or empty, the method attempts to decode the messageContent using the Base64.decode() method and the UTF8_CHARSET. If an UnsupportedEncodingException is thrown, the method generates a new UnexpectedStorageException using the Utility.generateNewUnexpectedStorageException() method.
2749	The getFileAndDirectoryList method takes an input stream and a CloudFileDirectory object as parameters and returns a ListResponse object containing a list of ListFileItem objects.

The FileListHandler class is used to handle the SAX events and populate the ListResponse object with the file and directory information. The getFileAndDirectoryList method is a static method, which means it can be called without creating an instance of the class. The getFileAndDirectoryList method is a public method, which means it can be called from
2750	In the applyContinuationToQueryBuilder method, the code checks if the continuationToken parameter is not null. If it is not null, the code adds the nextPartitionKey, nextRowKey, and nextTableName properties of the continuationToken object to the UriQueryBuilder object.

2830	In the code above, the getShare() method is overridden to return a CloudFileShare object. The method first checks if the share variable is null. If it is null, it creates a new CloudFileShare object using the getShareURI() method and the isUsePathStyleUris() method of the fileServiceClient object. The getShareURI() method returns a StorageUri object that represents the URI of the share. The isUsePathStyleUris() method returns a boolean value indicating whether path-style URIs should be used or not. Finally, the getCredentials() method of the fileServiceClient object is used
2831	.Several URIs can be combined into a single URI by appending the relative URI to the path of the base URI. The separator is used to separate the path of the base URI from the path of the relative URI. If the base URI does not have a path, the relative URI must start with the separator. If the relative URI does not start with the separator, the separator will be prepended.

2890	In the above code, the fireEvent method iterates over the listeners list and calls the eventOccurred method on each listener. The eventOccurred method takes an EVENT_TYPE parameter, which is the type of event that is being fired. The fireEvent method is used to notify all listeners that an event has occurred. The listeners list is a list of StorageEvent objects, which are instances of a class that implements the StorageEvent interface. The StorageEvent interface has a method called eventOccurred, which is called when an event occurs.
2891	In the code above, the fireSendingRequestEvent method is used to fire an event when a request is sent. The method takes three parameters: opContext, request, and result. The opContext parameter is the OperationContext object that represents the current operation. The request parameter is the HttpURLConnection object that represents the request that is being sent. The result parameter is the RequestResult object that represents the result of the request. The method first checks if there are any listeners registered for the SendingRequestEvent event.

The readDouble() method reads the next double value from the input stream and returns it as a double value. If the end of the stream is reached or an I/O error occurs, the readDouble() method throws an IOException.
2921	In Java, the readUuid() method is used to read a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) from an input stream. The method takes a boolean parameter isQuotedString, which indicates whether the UUID is enclosed in quotes or not. If the UUID is not enclosed in quotes, the method returns null. If the UUID is enclosed in quotes, the method returns a UUID object. The method throws an IOException if an I/O error occurs.
2922	As you can see, the readInteger() method first calls the readField() method to read a string from the input stream. If the string is null or empty, the method returns null. Otherwise, it converts the string to an integer using the parseInt() method and returns the result.

3025	Question: How can I get a list of all failed assertions from a Schematron output? Answer: You can get a list of all failed assertions from a Schematron output by using the getAllFailedAssertions method. This method takes a SchematronOutputType object as input and returns an ICommonsList of SVRLFailedAssert objects. The SVRLFailedAssert class represents a failed assertion in the Schematron output.
3026	In the method getAllFailedAssertionsMoreOrEqualSevereThan, the parameter aSchematronOutput is checked for null, but the parameter aErrorLevel is not. This can lead to a NullPointerException if aSchematronOutput is null and aErrorLevel is not. Code: @ Nonnull @ ReturnsMutableCopy public static ICommonsList < SVRLFailedAssert > getAllFailedAssertionsMoreOrEqualSevereThan ( @ Nullable final SchematronOutputType aSchematronOutput, @ Nonnull final IErrorLevel aErrorLevel ) { final ICommonsList < SVRLFailedAssert > ret = new Commons
3027	In the method getAllSuccessfulReports, the parameter aSchematronOutput is annotated with @Nullable, which indicates that it may be null. However, the method does not handle the case where aSchematronOutput is null. If aSchematronOutput is null, the method will throw a NullPointerException when it tries to access the getActivePatternAndFiredRuleAndFailedAssert method of aSchematronOutput.
3028	In the method getAllSuccessfulReportsMoreOrEqualSevereThan, the parameter aSchematronOutput is not checked for null. If aSchematronOutput is null, a NullPointerException will be thrown.
3029	Code: @ Nonnull @ ReturnsMutableCopy public static ICommonsList < AbstractSVRLMessage > getAllFailedAssertionsAndSuccessfulReports ( @ Nullable final SchematronOutputType aSchematronOutput ) { final ICommonsList < AbstractSVRLMessage > ret = new CommonsArrayList <> ( ) ; if ( aSchematronOutput!= null ) for ( final Object aObj : aSchematronOutput. getActivePatternAndFiredRuleAndFailedAssert ( ) ) if ( aObj instanceof FailedAssert ) ret. add ( new SVRLFailedAssert ( ( FailedAssert ) aObj ) ) ;
3030	In the method setErrorLevelDeterminator, the ValueEnforcer.notNull(aELD, "ErrorLevelDeterminator") statement is used to ensure that the aELD parameter is not null. However, the s_aRWLock.readLocked(() -> s_aELD = aELD) statement is not used to ensure that the s_aELD variable is not null. This can lead to a NullPointerException if the s_aELD variable is null. To fix this issue, the s_aRWLock.readLocked(() -> s_aELD = aELD) statement should be used to ensure that the s_aELD
3031	In the code above, the getQueryBindingOfName method is used to retrieve a query binding from a map based on its name. The method takes a string parameter sName, which is the name of the query binding to retrieve. The method first checks if the sName parameter is null, and if it is, it returns the default query binding. If the sName parameter is not null, the method uses the readLocked method of the s_aRWLock object to retrieve the query binding from the s_aMap map. The readLocked method ensures that only one thread can access the map at a time, preventing race conditions.
3032	The getQueryBindingOfNameOrThrow method returns the query binding of the given name or throws a SchematronBindException if no query binding implementation is present for the given name. Description: The getQueryBindingOfNameOrThrow method returns the query binding of the given name or throws a SchematronBindException if no query binding implementation is present for the given name.

Code: private String _format(final String format, final Object arg) { final FormattingTuple tuple = MessageFormatter.format(format, arg); return tuple.getMessage(); }
3035	In Java, the MessageFormatter.format() method is used to format a message using the specified format string and arguments. The format string can contain placeholders for the arguments, which are replaced with the actual values when the method is called. The method returns a FormattingTuple object, which contains the formatted message and any remaining arguments that were not used in the format. The getMessage() method of the FormattingTuple can be used to retrieve the formatted message.

3096	Question: What is the purpose of this code? Answer: The purpose of this code is to fetch the status of the SonarQube server. The code uses the openConnection method of the URL class to open a connection to the SonarQube server. The setRequestProperty method is used to set the Accept header to application/json, which tells the server that the client is expecting a JSON response. The getInputStream method is used to get the input stream of the response from the server. The toString method of the IOUtils class is used to convert the input stream to a string. Finally, the parseResponse method is used

The method takes an integer representing the build configuration ID as input and uses it to create a SetJoin between the ProductVersion and BuildConfiguration entities. It then uses the equal method to compare the build configuration ID of the joined BuildConfiguration entity with the input build configuration ID. The resulting Predicate can be used in a query to filter ProductVersion objects that have a matching build configuration ID.

3161	In the code above, the getModuleConfig method is used to retrieve the configuration for a specific module. The method takes a ConfigProvider as an argument, which is used to determine the type of the module configuration. The method first checks if the configuration has already been cached, and if so, it returns the cached configuration. If the configuration is not in the cache, the method uses the configurationJsonParser to parse the JSON configuration string and returns the parsed configuration. The method is synchronized to ensure that only one thread can access the cache at a time.

3296	In this code, the processEvent method takes an event object as an argument and iterates over a list of event handlers for the given event type. For each handler, it creates a new Runnable object and executes it using the EVENT_EXECUTOR executor. The Runnable object contains a try-catch block that handles any exceptions thrown by the event handler. If the shouldReRaiseOnError flag is set to true, the event will be re-published to the event queue if an exception is thrown. This allows the event to be processed by other event handlers that may be able to handle the exception.

3363	In this code, the filter method takes two parameters: filter, which is a Path.Filter object, and contentType, which is a Content.Type object. The method returns a new Filter object that implements the Filter interface. The matches method checks whether the given id and contentType match the filter and contentType parameters. The matchesSubpath method checks whether the given id is a subpath of the filter. The toString method returns a string representation of the filter.
3364	In this example, the or() method takes two Filter objects as input and returns a new Filter object that represents the logical OR of the two input filters. The matches() method of the returned filter will return true if either of the input filters matches the given path ID and content type. The matchesSubpath() method will return true if either of the input filters matches the given path ID. The toString() method returns a string representation of the filter, which is the concatenation of the string representations of the two input filters separated by a pipe character.

3572	The addContextConverter method of the MustacheEngineBuilder class is used to add a context converter to the builder. This method takes a ContextConverter object as an argument and adds it to the list of context converters that will be used when rendering the template. The ContextConverter interface defines a single method, convert, which is used to convert a value from the context to a string that can be used in the template. The addContextConverter method is used to add a custom context converter to the builder. This can be useful if you need to convert values in the context to a different type before they are used in the template. For example
3573	As the name suggests, this method capitalizes the first letter of each word in the given string. It also capitalizes the first letter of the string if the string is not empty.

3613	In this code, the animateVisibility method is used to animate the visibility of a view. The method takes two parameters: visibility, which is the desired visibility of the view, and duration, which is the duration of the animation in milliseconds. The method first checks if the visibilityAnimator is not null, and if so, it cancels the current animation. It then creates a listener for the animation using the createVisibilityAnimatorListener method. The targetScale is set to 1 if the visibility is View.VISIBLE, and 0 otherwise. The animationDuration is calculated based on the difference between the current scale and the target scale, and the
3614	Code: private AnimatorListener createVisibilityAnimatorListener ( final int visibility ) { return new AnimatorListenerAdapter ( ) { @ Override public void onAnimationStart ( final Animator animation ) { if ( visibility == View. VISIBLE ) { FloatingActionButton. super. setVisibility ( visibility ) ; } } @ Override public void onAnimationEnd ( final Animator animation ) { FloatingActionButton. super. setVisibility ( visibility ) ; visibilityAnimator = null ; } } ; } Summary:
3615	In the above code, the method setSize is annotated with the @NonNull annotation, which indicates that the parameter size must not be null. The ensureNotNull method is called to ensure that the size parameter is not null, and if it is, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. The method adaptShadow is called to adapt the shadow of the button based on the new size, and the method adaptImageButtonSize is called to adapt the size of the image button based on the new size. Finally, the requestLayout method is called to request a layout of the button.
3616	In the above code, the obtainThickness method is used to obtain the thickness of a circular progress bar.

3631	Question: How do you set the text color of a chip in Android?
  1. Code: private void obtainTextColor ( @ NonNull final TypedArray typedArray ) { int defaultColor = ContextCompat. getColor ( getContext ( ), R. color. chip_text_color_light ) ; setTextColor ( typedArray. getColor ( R. styleable. Chip_android_textColor, defaultColor ) ) ; } Summary: How do you set the text color of a chip in Android?
  2. Code: private void obtainTextColor ( @ NonNull final TypedArray typedArray ) { int defaultColor = ContextCompat. getColor
3632	In the code above, the obtainColor method takes a TypedArray as an argument and uses it to set the color of the chip. The method first gets the default color from the R.color.chip_color_light resource, and then sets the color of the chip using the getColor method of the ContextCompat class. The getColor method takes two arguments: the first is the context, and the second is the resource ID of the color to retrieve. The method returns the color as an integer value.
3633	Code: private void obtainIcon ( @ NonNull final TypedArray typedArray ) { setIcon ( typedArray. getDrawable ( R. styleable. Chip_android_icon ) ) ; }
Code: private void obtainIcon ( @ NonNull final TypedArray typedArray ) { setIcon ( typedArray. getDrawable ( R. styleable. Chip_android_icon ) ) ; }
3634	In the code above, the method obtainClosable is used to set the closable property of a chip based on the value of the R.styleable.chip_closable styleable. The boolean value is obtained from the typedArray using the getBoolean method, which returns true if the styleable is set to true, and false otherwise. The setClosable method is then used to set the closable property of the chip to the value returned by the getBoolean method.
3635	In the code above, the method obtainCloseIcon is used to retrieve the close button icon from a TypedArray object. The method getDrawable is called on the TypedArray object to retrieve the icon. If the icon is not null, the setCloseButtonIcon method is called to set the icon as the close button icon for the chip.
3636	In the above code, the method addCloseListener is declared as public and final. This means that the method cannot be overridden by subclasses and cannot be changed once it is defined. The @NonNull annotation is used to indicate that the listener parameter cannot be null. The ensureNotNull method is used to check that the listener parameter is not null, and if it is, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. The listeners field is used to store the listeners that have been added to the class. The add method is used to add the listener to the list of listeners.
3637	Rationale: This method can be called with a null argument, which is a violation of the JLS.

3643	In Java, the isPresent() method is used to check if an element is present in a collection or not. The method returns true if the element is present, and false otherwise. The method can be used to check if an element is present in a list, set, or map. The method can also be used to check if a key is present in a map. The method can also be used to check if a value is present in a map.
3644	In Java, the @SuppressWarnings annotation is used to suppress warnings generated by the compiler. The getAnnotationValue method is used to retrieve the value of an annotation attribute. The method takes four parameters: importingClassMetadata, annotationClass, name, and defaultValue. The importingClassMetadata parameter is the metadata of the class that is importing the annotation. The annotationClass parameter is the class of the annotation. The name parameter is the name of the attribute whose value is to be retrieved. The defaultValue parameter is the default value to be returned if the attribute is not found. The method returns the value of the attribute or the default value if the attribute

3649	In this article, we will show you how to check if a string is not null or empty in Java. To check if a string is not null or empty in Java, you can use the isEmpty() method of the String class. This method returns true if the string is empty, and false otherwise. You can also use the isBlank() method of the StringUtils class from the Apache Commons Lang library. This method returns true if the string is empty or contains only whitespace characters, and false otherwise. Finally, you can use the trim() method of the String class to remove leading and trailing whitespace characters from the string, and then check
3650	In the code above, the method getListener is synchronized, which means that only one thread can execute it at a time. This is necessary because the method accesses and modifies the mListeners map, which is not thread-safe. The if statement checks if the listener with the given id is already in the map, and if not, it creates a new listener and adds it to the map. The return statement returns the listener with the given id. The synchronized keyword ensures that only one thread can execute the method at a time, preventing race conditions and ensuring that the map is accessed and modified correctly.

The method takes two parameters: tag, which is the tag associated with the request, and mayInterrupt, which indicates whether the request should be interrupted or not. The method first checks if the tag is present in the map mTaggedRequests. If it is, the method returns the result of calling the cancel() method with the id of the request and the mayInterrupt parameter. Otherwise, it returns false.

3660	In the code above, the onOperationFinished method is called when an operation is finished. The method takes an OperationDelivery object as an argument, which represents the result of the operation. The code checks the current state of the operation using the mState variable. If the state is PAUSED, the result is stored using the storeResult method. If the state is RESUMED, the result is delivered using the deliverResult method. Otherwise, an IllegalStateException is thrown with a message indicating that the state is unknown.
3661	In the above code, the storeResult method takes an OperationDelivery object as an argument and stores it in a list of SoftReference objects. The SoftReference class is used to store weak references to objects, which means that the object will be garbage collected if there are no strong references to it. This is useful in this case because the OperationDelivery object may not be needed anymore once it has been stored in the list, so it can be garbage collected to free up memory. The logd method is used to print a debug message to the log.
3662	In the deliverResult() method, the switch statement checks the delivery mode of the operationDelivery object. If the delivery mode is NORMAL, the method calls deliverResult() with the result of the operationDelivery, the callback method name, and true. If the delivery mode is BROADCAST, the method calls deliverResult() with the result of the operationDelivery, the broadcast callback method name, and false.
3663	In the deliverResult() method, there is a for loop that iterates over the methods of the mServiceListener class and checks if any of them is a callback method for the given operation result. If a callback method is found, it is invoked with the operation result as an argument. However, if no callback method is found, a warning is logged. The problem with this code is that it is not thread-safe. Multiple threads can call the deliverResult() method at the same time, which can lead to race conditions. For example, if two threads call deliverResult() at the same time, one thread might find a callback
3664	phpMyAdmin is a free software tool written in PHP, intended to handle the administration of MySQL over the World Wide Web. phpMyAdmin supports a wide range of operations on MySQL, MariaDB and Drizzle. Frequently used operations (such as creating, editing or deleting databases, tables, fields or rows) can be performed via the user interface, while you still have the option to directly execute any SQL statement. phpMyAdmin includes a web interface that can display the contents of databases, tables, columns and rows. There is also support for executing SQL statements, creating tables and indexes, managing users and permissions. Additionally, you can
3665	In this code, the method cancel is synchronized, which means that it can only be executed by one thread at a time. The method takes three parameters: id, mayInterrupt, and removeOperation. The first parameter, id, is used to identify the operation that is being cancelled. The second parameter, mayInterrupt, indicates whether the operation should be interrupted or not. The third parameter, removeOperation, indicates whether the operation should be removed from the list of running operations or not. The method first checks if there is a running operation with the given id. If there is no running operation, the method returns false. If there is
3666	Code: synchronized final void operationStarted ( final int id, @ NonNull final ChronosOperation <? > operation, @ NonNull final Future <? > future ) { mRunningOperations. put ( id, new RunningOperation ( operation, future ) ) ; }
Code: synchronized final void operationStarted ( final int id, @ NonNull final ChronosOperation <? > operation, @ NonNull final Future <? > future ) { mRunningOperations. put ( id, new RunningOperation ( operation, future ) ) ; }
3667	In Java, the synchronized keyword is used to ensure that only one thread can execute a block of code at a time. The final keyword is used to indicate that a method cannot be overridden in a subclass. The void keyword is used to indicate that a method does not return a value. The cancelAll method is used to cancel all running operations. The mayInterrupt parameter is used to indicate whether or not the operation should be interrupted. The false parameter is used to indicate that the operation should not be interrupted.
Code: synchronized final void cancelAll ( final boolean mayInterrupt ) { for ( final Integer key : mRunningOperations. keySet

3669	As you can see, this method takes two parameters: operation and operationResult. The operation parameter is of type ChronosOperation, which is an interface that represents an operation that can be run. The operationResult parameter is of type ChronosOperationResult, which is an interface that represents the result of running an operation. The method first tries to run the operation, and if it succeeds, it sets the output of the operationResult to the output of the operation. If the operation fails, it sets the exception of the operationResult to the exception thrown by the operation.
3670	In Java, the @NonNull annotation is used to indicate that a parameter, return value, or field must not be null. The @Contract annotation is used to specify the contract of a method, including its preconditions, postconditions, and side effects. The pure attribute of the @Contract annotation indicates that the method is pure, meaning that it has no side effects and always returns the same result for the same input. The createEmptyResult method is used to create an empty result for a ChronosOperation. It takes two parameters: the operation and a boolean indicating whether the result should be broadcast. The method creates a new instance of

The result parameter is an instance of SimpleOperation.Result, which contains information about the result of the operation. The isSuccessful method returns true if the operation was successful, and false otherwise. The getOutput method returns the output of the operation, and the getErrorMessage method returns the error message if the operation failed. In this case, if the operation was successful, the mData variable is set to the output of the operation, and the showData method is called to display the data. If the operation failed, the error

The style attribute sets the margin-left property of the junction component to a value based on the level of the node. The level of the node is determined by the getLevel method of the UIStructurBrowser model object. If the level is greater than 0, the margin-left property is set to 15 times the level minus 1. This ensures that the junction component is indented based on its level in the hierarchy.

The dndType attribute is set to the value of the dndType property of the DnDBehavior class. This allows the dndType attribute to be used to identify the type of item being dragged and dropped. The class attribute is also updated to include the value of the dndType attribute. This allows the item to be styled differently based on its type.
3824	In the renderHead() method of the DnDBehavior class, a new StringBuilder is used to create a JavaScript string that defines a new dojo.dnd.Source object and sets its accept property to the dndType property of the DnDBehavior object. The onDrop event handler is then attached to the nSrc object using the aspect.after() method. The appendJavaScript property of the DnDBehavior object is used to add additional JavaScript code to the onDrop event handler. Finally, the OnDojoReadyHeaderItem is used to render the JavaScript code in the page header.

4270	In the above code, the getRaw method is synchronized, which means that only one thread can execute this method at a time. This is necessary because the getTTLObject and isExpired methods are also synchronized, and if multiple threads were allowed to execute the getRaw method at the same time, there could be a race condition where one thread reads the object from the cache while another thread is updating it. This could lead to inconsistent results or even data corruption. The synchronized keyword ensures that only one thread can execute the getRaw method at a time, preventing this race condition.

If the argument is not a valid integer value, the method ignores it and does not change the word wrap property.
4435	In this post, we will see how to get the length of the longest line in a string in Java. We can use the split() method of the String class to split the string into an array of lines, and then use the length() method of the String class to get the length of each line. Finally, we can use the max() method of the Math class to get the length of the longest line.

4474	In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the ViewPropertyAnimator class to animate the scale of a view. The ViewPropertyAnimator class provides a convenient way to animate the properties of a view, such as its position, size, and rotation. We will use the scale method to animate the scale of a view. The scale method takes three parameters: the view to animate, the scale factor, and the duration of the animation. The scale factor is a float value between 0.0f and 1.0f, where 0.0f is the minimum scale and 1.0f is the maximum scale

The method uses a StringBuilder to build the resulting string, and appends each address line to the StringBuilder using the append method. If the current address line is not the first one, the delimiter is appended before it. Finally, the toString method is called on the StringBuilder to get the resulting string.

4487	In this tutorial, we will learn how to check if a cursor is closed or not in Android.
How do you check if a cursor is empty?
To check if a cursor is empty, you can use the isEmpty() method of the Cursor class. The isEmpty() method returns true if the cursor is empty, and false otherwise.
How do you check if a cursor is not null?
To check if a cursor is not null, you can use the isNull() method of the Cursor class. The isNull() method returns true if the cursor is null, and false otherwise.

Code: public static int count ( Cursor cursor, boolean close ) { int count = cursor. getCount ( ) ; close ( cursor, close ) ; return count ; }
4489	In this article, we will learn how to get the first value from a cursor in Android. We can use the moveToFirst() method to move the cursor to the first row and then use the getInt() method to get the value of the first column. We can also use the close() method to close the cursor.

Code: public static int firstInt ( Cursor cursor, boolean close ) { int i = cursor. moveToFirst ( )? cursor. getInt ( 0 ) : Integer. MIN_VALUE ; close ( cursor, close ) ; return i ; }
4490	Closes the cursor and returns the first long value from the cursor, or Long.MIN_VALUE if the cursor is empty. Code: public static long firstLong ( Cursor cursor, boolean close ) { long l = cursor. moveToFirst ( )? cursor. getLong ( 0 ) : Long. MIN_VALUE ; close ( cursor, close ) ; return l ; } Summary: Closes the cursor and returns the first long value from the cursor, or Long.MIN_VALUE if the cursor is empty.

4492	In this code, the method allInts returns an array of integers from a Cursor object. The method takes two parameters: cursor, which is the Cursor object, and close, which is a boolean indicating whether or not to close the cursor after retrieving the data. The method first checks if the cursor has any data by calling moveToFirst. If there is data, it creates a new array of integers with the same size as the number of rows in the cursor. Then, it loops through each row in the cursor, retrieving the integer value from the first column and storing it in the corresponding position in the array. Finally, the method
4493	* Returns an array of all the long values in the given cursor. * * @param cursor the cursor * @param close whether to close the cursor * @return an array of all the long values in the cursor * @throws SQLiteException if an error occurs

Looper.getMainLooper() returns the Looper for the main thread or null if the main thread does not have a Looper.
4501	In the above code, the @SuppressWarnings annotation is used to suppress the unchecked warning generated by the compiler. The unchecked warning is generated because the method values() returns a List, which is a raw type, and the method is called with a parameter of type SparseArray, which is a generic type. The @SuppressWarnings annotation is used to tell the compiler that the unchecked warning is intentional and should be ignored.

4664	In this article, we will show you how to convert an InputStream to a byte array in Java. There are several ways to convert an InputStream to a byte array in Java. One way is to use the read() method of the InputStream class. This method reads bytes from the input stream and stores them in a byte array. Another way is to use the readAllBytes() method of the Files class. This method reads all bytes from the input stream and stores them in a byte array. Finally, you can use the readNBytes() method of the Files class. This method reads a specified number of bytes from the input stream and
4665	In this example, the readFileToString method takes a File object as input and returns the contents of the file as a String. The method first checks that the file exists, is not a directory, and can be read. If any of these conditions are not met, the method throws an exception. The method then creates a FileInputStream to read the file, and uses the getString method to read the contents of the file and return it as a String.

4670	In this code, we have a method that takes a set and a maximum size as input and returns a list of sets. The method first checks if the size of the input set is less than the maximum size, in which case it returns a singleton list containing the input set. If the size is greater than or equal to the maximum size, the method creates a new list and iterates over the input set, adding elements to a new set until the maximum size is reached. It then adds the new set to the list and continues iterating until all elements have been processed. The method returns the list of sets.
4671	In this article, we will discuss how to get the first day of the month from a given date in Java. We will use the java.time.LocalDate class to get the first day of the month. We will also discuss how to get the last day of the month from a given date in Java. We will use the java.time.LocalDate class to get the last day of the month. We will also discuss how to get the first and last day of the month from a given date in Java. We will use the java.time.LocalDate class to get the first and last day of the month.
4672	Question: How do you get the last day of the month in Java? Answer: You can get the last day of the month in Java by using the LocalDate class. The LocalDate class has a method called withDayOfMonth() that allows you to set the day of the month. You can use this method to set the day of the month to 1, which will give you the first day of the month. Then, you can use the plus() method to add one month to the date. Finally, you can use the minus() method to subtract one day from the date, which will give you the last day of the month
4673	In Java, the trimToNull() method is used to remove leading and trailing spaces from a string and return null if the string is empty. The trimToNull() method is a static method of the StringUtils class, which is part of the Apache Commons Lang library. The method takes a string as input and returns a new string with leading and trailing spaces removed. If the input string is null or empty, the method returns null. Here is an example of how to use the trimToNull() method: String text = " Hello, World! " ; String trimmedText = StringUtils. trimToNull ( text ) ; System.
4674	1. If the input is null, return null. 2. If the length of the input is greater than 1, loop through each character in the input. 3. If the current character is alphabetic, return the substring up to the current character, the uppercase version of the current character, and the substring after the current character. 4. Otherwise, return the uppercase version of the input.
4675	Splits this string around matches of the given regular expression. This method works as if by invoking the two-argument split method with the given expression and a limit argument of zero. Thus, the result is an array of all substrings between each successive match of the given expression and the end of the string. If the given expression does not match the string, this method returns an array of length 1 whose only element is the input string. The limit parameter controls the number of times the pattern is applied and therefore affects the length of the resulting array. If the limit n is greater than zero then the pattern will be applied at most

4677	Splits a string into a list of words using a regular expression.
4678	In this example, the trimTextDown method takes a string and a size as input. If the length of the string is less than or equal to the given size, the method returns the original string. Otherwise, it finds the last space character in the string before the given size and returns the substring of the string up to that space character.
4679	* Trims the text down to the given size minus the length of the append string. If the text is shorter than the size minus the length of the append string, the text is returned as is. If the text is longer than the size minus the length of the append string, the text is trimmed down to the size minus the length of the append string and the append string is appended.

4682	In this article, we will learn how to remove quotes from a string in Java. We can remove quotes from a string in Java using the replace() method of the String class. The replace() method returns a new string in which all occurrences of a specified value have been replaced with another value. Syntax: public String replace(char oldChar, char newChar) Parameters: oldChar: The character to be replaced. newChar: The character to replace oldChar. Return value: A string in which all occurrences of oldChar have been replaced with newChar. Example: public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) {
4683	In Java, the getTimezoneTime method is used to calculate the time in a specific timezone. The method takes two arguments: time, which is the time in milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT, and timezone, which is the number of hours to add or subtract from the time. The method returns the time in milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT in the specified timezone. The method uses the Calendar class to perform the calculation.

4707	In this article, we will learn how to set a property of an object using reflection in Java. We can set a property of an object using reflection by using the setProperty method of the Introspector class. The setProperty method takes three arguments: the target object, the name of the property to set, and the value to set the property to. The setProperty method returns a boolean value indicating whether the property was set successfully. Here is an example of how to use the setProperty method to set the name property of a Person object: Person person = new Person ( ) ; person. setName ( "John Doe" )
4708	In Java, the setField method is a static method that is used to set the value of a field in an object. The method takes three parameters: the target object, the name of the field to set, and the new value to set the field to. The method first checks if the field exists in the target object’s class using the getDeclaredField method. If the field does not exist, the method returns false. If the field does exist, the method sets the field’s value using the set method. The method then returns true to indicate that the field was successfully set.

4765	1. BufferedReader is used to read text from a character-input stream, buffering characters so as to provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines. The buffer size may be specified, or the default size may be used. The default is large enough for most purposes. In general, each read request made of a Reader causes a corresponding read request to be made of the underlying character or byte stream. It is therefore advisable to wrap a BufferedReader around any Reader whose read() operations may be costly, such as FileReaders and InputStreamReaders. For example, it is a good idea to wrap a BufferedReader around an InputStreamReader when

The debugEnabled argument is a boolean that indicates whether or not debugging information should be printed to the console. The quiet argument is also a boolean that indicates whether or not error messages should be printed to the console. The body of the method starts by setting the debugEnabled variable to the value of the debugEnabled argument. It then calls the parseCommandLineArguments() method to parse the command-line arguments. Next, it prints "Connecting..." to

4813	Finds the first type argument of a parameterized type. If the type is not a parameterized type, null is returned.
4814	1. Find the class that declares the type variable. 2. Find the parameterized types of the class. 3. Find the type variable in the parameterized types. 4. Return the parameterized type that contains the type variable.
4815	In order to find the type arguments of an interface, we need to find all the parameterized types of the class that implements the interface. We can do this by using the findParameterizedTypes method, which takes a class and an interface as input. If the class implements the interface, the method will return the type arguments of the interface. If the class does not implement the interface, the method will return null.

4818	In Java, the returnObject() method is used to return an object to the ObjectPool. This method is used when the object is no longer needed and should be returned to the pool so that it can be used by other threads. The returnObject() method throws an exception if the object is not in the pool or if there is an error returning the object to the pool.

4820	In this example, the getConsumer() method is used to retrieve a MessageConsumer object for a given destination name. The method first checks if the consumers map contains an entry for the given destination name. If not, it creates a new MessageConsumer object using the createConsumer() method of the Session object and adds it to the consumers map. If an exception is thrown, it is wrapped in a JmsException and rethrown. Finally, the method returns the MessageConsumer object for the given destination name.
4821	In this example, the getProducer method is used to retrieve a MessageProducer instance for a given destination name. The method first checks if the producers map contains an entry for the given destination name. If not, it creates a new MessageProducer instance using the createProducer method of the Session object and adds it to the producers map using the destination name as the key. Finally, the method returns the MessageProducer instance for the given destination name.

4823	In this article, we have seen how to connect to an ActiveMQ server using the JMS API. We have seen how to create a connection factory, create a connection, create a session, create a destination, create a producer, create a consumer, send a message, receive a message, and close the connection. We have also seen how to handle exceptions that may occur during the connection process.
4824	Code: public void sendTextMessageWithDestination ( final String destinationName, final String messageContent ) { if (! this. isConnected ( ) ) { throw new JmsNotConnectedException ( "JMS connection is down " + destinationName ) ; } final Session session = getSession ( ) ; final MessageProducer producer = getProducer ( destinationName ) ; try { TextMessage message = session. createTextMessage ( messageContent ) ; producer. send ( message ) ; } catch ( JMSException e ) { throw new JmsException ( "Unable to send message to " + destinationName, e ) ; } }
4825	In this code, the listenTextMessagesWithDestination method takes two parameters: destinationName, which is the name of the destination to listen to, and messageListener, which is a Consumer that will be called when a message is received. The method first creates a MessageConsumer using the getConsumer method. Then, it sets the messageListener on the consumer using the setMessageListener method. If the acknowledgeMode is set to Session.CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE, the method acknowledges the message using the message.acknowledge() method. Finally, the method catches any exceptions that may occur and throws a JmsException.
4826	The receiveTextMessageFromDestinationWithTimeout method is used to receive a text message from a destination with a timeout. The method takes two parameters: destinationName, which is the name of the destination to receive the message from, and timeout, which is the timeout in milliseconds. The method first checks if the connection is connected. If not, it throws a JmsNotConnectedException. If the connection is connected, it gets the consumer for the destination. If the timeout is 0, it receives the message without waiting. If the timeout is not 0, it receives the message with the specified timeout. If a message is received

4851	In this article, we will learn how to create a JNDI InitialContext in Java. JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface) is a Java API that provides a unified interface to different naming and directory services. It allows Java applications to look up objects by name, regardless of where those objects are located. JNDI is commonly used in Java EE applications to look up resources such as EJBs, JDBC data sources, and JMS queues. To create a JNDI InitialContext, you need to provide a set of properties that specify the location of the naming and directory service you want to use. These properties

4857	As you can see, the introspectSerializer method takes two parameters: beanSerializer and type. The beanSerializer parameter is an instance of BeanSerializerBase, which is the base class for all bean serializers. The type parameter is an instance of CustomType, which is a class that represents a custom type. The introspectSerializer method uses reflection to get the _props field from the beanSerializer object, which is an array of BeanPropertyWriter objects. The introspectSerializer method then loops through the props array and gets the type of each property using the getType method. It then creates a signature for the property using the JacksonSignature.createSignature
4858	In Java, the introspectSerializer method is used to serialize and deserialize objects. The method takes two parameters: an EnumSerializer and a CustomType. The EnumSerializer is used to serialize the object, and the CustomType is used to deserialize the object. The method loops through the values of the EnumSerializer and adds them to the CustomType. This allows the object to be serialized and deserialized correctly.
