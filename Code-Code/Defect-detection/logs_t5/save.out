Some weights of T5ForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at Salesforce/codet5p-770m and are newly initialized: ['classification_head.dense.bias', 'classification_head.dense.weight', 'classification_head.out_proj.bias', 'classification_head.out_proj.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
WARNING:bitsandbytes.cextension:The installed version of bitsandbytes was compiled without GPU support. 8-bit optimizers and GPU quantization are unavailable.
